// 1. Write a function called shout that takes in a string as an argument and returns it in all caps.




// 2. Write a function called whisper that takes in a string as an argument and returns it in all lowercase.





// 3. Write a function called howManyLetters that takes in a string as an argument and returns the number of letters in that string.





// 4. Write a function called workIt that takes in a string as an argument and returns it backwards and with the first letter capitalized.
//    For example, workIt("I put my thing down flip it and reverse it") would return "Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gniht ym tup i"





// 5. Write a function called repeatIt that takes in a word and a number, and returns the word that many times.
//    For example, repeatIt("Banana", 3) would return "BananaBananaBanana"





// 6. Write a function called willItNametag that takes in a name and a number, and tells you whether the name can be printed on a nametag that size.
//    For example, willItNametag("Peter", 10) will return true, but willItNametag("Peter", 4) will return false, because "Peter" is 5 letters long, and needs at least 5 spaces to fit on a nametag.





// 7. Write a function called addLiar that takes in two numbers and prints out a lie like "Sorry, I don't know how to add ___ and ___."
//    BUT even though it *prints* that it doesn't know the answer, have the function return the correct answer anyways.





// 8. CHALLENGE: Now that you've written all these functions, try combining them. what would happen if you tried to call repeatIt(workIt("Stressed"), 3) ?





// 9. MEGA CHALLENGE: Write a function called doubler that takes in a string and returns it with every letter doubled.
//    For example, doubler("Lost in the Woods") would return "LLoosstt iinn tthhee WWooooddss"
